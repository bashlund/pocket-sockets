# pocket-sockets

A powerful and smooth sockets library for browser and _Node.js_, support for both _WebSockets_ and regular _TCP_ sockets.  
Supports TLS encryption.

## WebSockets vs. regular TCP sockets
_WebSockets_ are a must when using a browser, however plain _TCP_ sockets are faster and a good choice when no browser is involved.

The overall interface for _pocket-sockets_ _WebSocket_ and _TCP_ sockets are the same so it is easy to switch between the underlying implementations.
